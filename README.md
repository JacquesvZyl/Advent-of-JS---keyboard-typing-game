# Brief

In this project, we're going to create a computer keyboard.

You can use as many (or as few) tools, libraries, and frameworks as you'd like. If you're trying to learn something new, this would be a great way to push yourself.

**Users should be able to:**

- See the computer keyboard centered on the page
- A random letter will start to jiggle.
- The user should type the same key that's jiggling and it will stop.
- A new, random key will start jiggling

**My Comments:**
Much easier than I expected. NOTE: I have only written the logic. All styling and markup was given to me as part of the challenge.

**What I learned:**
Data Attributes! Wasn't aware of this functionality. It makes this challenge much easier (although you could probably get the same result by fetching the element's innerText attribute)
